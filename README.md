# eCommerce mobile app

<h2> A Flutter mobile eCommerce application. </h2>

What?
The application is a comprehensive eCommerce platform built with Flutter. 
It allows users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and manage their orders.

How?
Users begin by creating an account, which simultaneously creates a profile in Firebase Authentication and Firestore. 
Upon account creation, a unique shopping cart is assigned. 
Users can then add products to their cart, with each item stored in the "cartItems" subcollection, capturing necessary details like the addition date, image URL, price, product ID, quantity, and title.

Why?
I embarked on this project to challenge myself and explore the intricacies of developing a full-fledged eCommerce application with Flutter. 
The goal was to grasp how various components - user authentication, database management, and frontend development - synergize to create a seamless shopping experience.

Learned?
 - Gained proficiency in developing complex widget trees in Flutter to create dynamic, responsive, and intuitive user interfaces.
 - Leveraged Flutter for front-end development to create a seamless and interactive user interface.
 - Implemented Provider package for efficient state management and dependency injection.
 - Utilized Firebase for back-end operations, specifically its Authentication and Firestore modules for user management and database functionalities.
 - Employed APIs to fetch product data, enriching the application's features.
 - Integrated Firebase Cloud Storage for application hosting.
 - Developed an understanding of how these different technologies and tools interplay in a real-world application setting.
